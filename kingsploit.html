<h1 class="ContainerTitle">Let's cut to the chase.</h1>
<p class="ContainerParagraph"><b>Synapse X</b> has been the world's foremost scripting utility since our earliest days in <b>2016</b>. We have raised the bar in the industry and with every update we are setting new standards. Through thick and thin, we have developed a product that matches our customers' expectations, and we will continue to offer what we do best as long as there is demand for it.</p>
<p class="ContainerParagraph"><b>Synapse X</b> began as a tiny collaboration between friends in early 2016. We were always very passionate about programming and bringing fun into the complicated universe of computers, and we decided to share this passion of ours with the world. Over the years, our hobby slowly grew into a viable commercial project — something we could, with hard work, eventually do for a living. This, of course, was only an ambition for most of us, and we never seriously considered that we could thrive on our hobby alone. But history has a tendency to surprise us, and <b>Synapse X</b> was the next surprise it reserved to us. Our hobby turned commercial project became our life's work, and we are happy to see that it grows every day, as we work on it every day. There is no greater feeling than to know that your life's passion has became your meaning in this world, and we are grateful for it.</p>
<p class="ContainerParagraph">Let us be frank: our dedication to this project has resulted in what we can safely call the <b>world's foremost script utility</b>. Our reputation is unmatched by our competitors, and when we notice that we get behind, we always kick ourselves forward so that we surpass our own standards. We take our time, we are thorough in our work, and it results in a quality that you cannot find elsewhere.</p>
<p class="ContainerParagraph">And since 2016, we always offered our product for the same price: a mere <b>$20</b>. Cheap enough so that you don't break the bank, but expensive enough to support us and our infrastructure. So why not check us out?</p>

<h1 class="ContainerTitle">If you have questions, we got the answers.</h1>
<div class="ContainerParagraph" style="">
<p>Is <b>Synapse X</b> legal? I've heard elsewhere that the product could be illegal.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Yes.</b> Synapse X is completely legal to purchase and use in the Americas and in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is <b>Synapse X</b> dangerous? I've heard elsewhere that Synapse X caused computer or account problems for some people, and that it was even detected by some antiviruses.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Absolutely not.</b> Synapse X is entirely safe for use and cannot damage your computer, and any virus detections are false positives due to the product's nature. As for bans, it is always a matter of vigilance - using the product to gain an explicit unfair advantage over other users can result in consequences, but we have taken steps to make sure our product is undetectable.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are <b>Synapse X</b>'s computer requirements?</p>
<ul>
<li>We recommend installing Synapse X on a 64-bit computer running Windows 10 with the latest updates available from Microsoft. However, all operating systems above Windows 8 should be technically compatible with the product as well, but we do not guarantee stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>How much does <b>Synapse X</b> cost?</p>
<ul>
<li>The prices ranges from <b>$15</b> USD to <b>$20</b> USD. If you are buying with a credit card or a bank account via PayPal, the price will be $20. If you are buying with cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum (amongst others), the price will be $15, such as to promote the usage of anonymous cryptocurrencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long does a copy of <b>Synapse X</b> last?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>FOREVER!</b> Buying Synapse X entitles you a permanent subscription to the product with no recurring payments and all updates offered free of charge.</li>
